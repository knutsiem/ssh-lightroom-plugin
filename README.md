# SSH Lightroom Plugin

A plugin for Adobe Lightroom to publish content via SSH.


## Requirements

The plugin requires the *ssh* and *scp* utilities locally and a Unix-like shell on the remote side.


## "Building" from source

Copy the source files to a .lrplugin directory, e.g. `cp -R src/ ssh.lrplugin`, and point Lightroom to this directory.
